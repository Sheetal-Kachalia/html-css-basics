            <li>
              React is officially defined as a 'Javascript library for creating
              user interfaces,' but what does that really mean?
            </li>
            <li>
              React is a library, made in Javascript and which we code in
              Javascript,to build great applications that run on the web.
            </li>

<div>
    <h3 class="heading3">What do I need to know for React?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In other words, you do need to have a basic understanding of
            JavaScript to become a solid React programmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most basic JavaScript concepts you should be familiar with are
            variables, basic data types, conditionals, array methods, functions,
            and ES modules.
        </li>
        <li>

            comprehensive guide to learn all of the JavaScript you need for React.</li>

        <div>
            <h3 class="heading3">If React was made in JavaScript, why don't we just use
                JavaScript?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    While React was written in JavaScript, which was built from the ground up for
                    the express purpose of building web applications and gives us tools to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript is a 20+ year old language which was created for adding small bits
                    of behavior to the browser through scripts and was not designed for creating
                    complete applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In other words, while JavaScript was used to create React, they were created
                    for very different purposes.</li>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="heading3">Can I use JavaScript in React applications?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Yes! Any valid JavaScript code can be included within your React applications.                        </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can use any browser or window API, such as geolocation or the fetch API.
                        </li>

                        Also, since React (when it is compiled) runs in the browser, you can perform
                        common JavaScript actions like DOM querying and manipulation.                        </li>

        <h3 class="heading3">What is the best way to create a React app?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Which is the best approach for you? The best way to create your application
    depends on what you want to do with it.</li>
  <li>If you want to create a complete web application that you want to ultimately
      push to the web, it is best to create that React application on your computer
      using a tool like Create React App.</li>
  <li>If you are interested in creating React apps on your computer, check out the
        complete guide to using Create React App.</li>
  <li>The easiest and most beginner-friendly way to create and build React apps for
          learning and prototyping is to use a tool like CodeSandbox. You can create a
          new React app in seconds by going to react.new!</li>

  <h2>JSX Elements</h2>
  <h3 class="heading3">JSX is a powerful tool for structuring applications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>JSX is meant to make create user interfaces with JavaScript applications
      easier.</li>
    <li>JSX borrows its syntax from the most widely used programming language:
        HTML</li>
    <li>As a result, JSX is a powerful tool to structure our applications.</li>
